# Week 1

Welcome students to the course! Introduce astronomy research at a general level (what is it, how do we do it, etc) and begin exploring different subfields.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Course overview](./course_overview.pdf) and syllabus review
- 📝 **Presentation:** [What is astronomy research?](./what_is_astronomy_research.pdf)
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Making a subfield map](./subfield_map.jpeg) - *I asked students what areas of astronomy research they were familiar with. Together, we created a "mind map" of astronomy subfields on the board.*

## Notes

- We ended slightly early
- The activity went well! Students had a lot of ideas and seemed to enjoy discussing them. I tried to comment on each suggestion (explaining why astronomers care about a certain subfield, asking students which other subfields it should be connected to, etc)
- The main takeaway that I tied back to was that although astronomers specialize, there's a lot of interesting research out there and as undergrads, the students should explore multiple topics to find what they're interested in
