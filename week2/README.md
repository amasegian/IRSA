# Week 2

Introduce students to career paths in astronomy (both academic and non-academic), and continue exploration of astronomy subfields.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Academic and non-academic career paths](./NOTES_career_paths_in_astronomy.pdf)
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Reflection on goals for the semester and beyond](./week2_reflection.pdf) - *Students were asked to complete the attached Google Form. I told them that their responses would not be graded, and that I would read them in advance of our 1-1 meeting.*
- 💬 **Discussion:** [Exploring astronomy subfields](./NOTES_astronomy_subfields.pdf)

## Notes

- I was away this week for an observing run, so my co-teachers led the class
- In the future, I would consider spreading out the exposure to astronomy subfields (e.g. by doing a short presentation on one subfield at the start of class, for the first few classes), but this might require delaying topic selection for the semester-long project
- One student commented that they felt this and the first week could be combined
