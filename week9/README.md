# Week 9

Expose students to research opportunities in the department through the annual pitch session, and discuss grad life at Columbia.

## Schedule

- 👥 **Pitch session:** Summer research projects - *7 upper-level graduate students and postdocs from Columbia Astronomy gave 10-minute pitches on summer research projects.*
- 📝 **Presentation:** [Week in the life of a Columbia grad student](./week_in_the_life.pdf) - *I shared a bit about my weekly schedule and responsibilities as a grad student.*
- 🕑 **Coworking time:** Milestone 2

## Assignments

Students were expected to continue working on Milestone 2. 

## Notes

- The pitch session ran right on schedule, with 10 minutes for each pitch and 5 minutes for questions. I asked presenters to come 15 minutes apart and we were never waiting long!
- Many presenters brought a few slides or used the chalkboard to sketch concepts related to their projects.
- After the pitch session, I distributed the names, emails, and project titles of each pitch-er to the students and encouraged them to reach out directly if they were interested in a certain project.
