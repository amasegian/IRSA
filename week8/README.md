# Week 8

Introduce students to spectroscopy and have them work with real data from the GALAH survey.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Spectroscopy and GALAH data](./spectroscopy_and_galah.pdf) - *Also including a review of photometry and color-magnitude diagrams, which I forgot to cover the previous week*
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Working with GALAH data](./spec-data_curve-fitting.ipynb) - *I coded live so students could follow along.*
- 🕑 **Coworking time:** Milestone 2

## Assignments

Students were expected to continue working on Milestone 2.

## Notes

- The GALAH activity ran slightly longer than I expected, and getting the students to engage was a bit difficult
- I suspect students were feeling a bit lost with some of the more advanced Python concepts (plotting, etc) -- more evidence that this section of the course needs to be expanded/slowed down
