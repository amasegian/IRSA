# Week 3

Introduction the purpose and structure of the scientific literature, including the purposes of different types of papers (mainly focused on review papers vs journal articles), where to find them, and general reading strategies. 

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Observing at MDM](./observing_at_mdm.pdf) - *I told the students about the observing run I had been on the previous week, to give them some flavor of what observational astronomy is really like.*
- 📝 **Presentation:** [Intro to read scientific papers](./reading_scientific_papers.pdf) - *Slide 2 only: what papers are, their purpose, and review papers vs journal articles. My goal was to avoid giving away information that students would discover themselves in the activity.*
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Piecing together a scientific paper](./activity/) - *Described more in slides 3-5 [here](./reading_scientific_papers.pdf). Students were divided into small groups. Within each group, each student was given a different "chunk" of an astronomy paper. After some individual reading time, they discussed as a group to answer a set of questions about the paper's purpose, and to guess what order the sections should be arranged in.*  
- 📝 **Presentation:** Activity debrief, reading strategies, and where to find papers (including live demos) - *Slides 5+ [here](./reading_scientific_papers.pdf)*

## Assignments

Students were asked to spend some time searching for papers related to their semester-long project topic. Before the next class, they were expected to submit the NASA ADS link to one journal article and one review article, so I could review their choices and make suggestions for changes if needed.

Students were also asked to install Miniconda before the next class, and to come to office hours if they experienced any issues.

## Notes

- The activity went well! Most students had some familiarity with the scientific method, and were able to piece together the paper easily
- It would be helpful to write up a more detailed primer on searching for astronomy papers, so students had something to refer back to when working on their projects
- In the future, I would probably provide the review article for each project, and have students search only for the journal article themselves (since good review papers were harder to find)
