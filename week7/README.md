# Week 7

Introduce students to the Gaia mission and have them play with real Gaia data.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** Astronomy in the era of large surveys - *Led by David Helfand. Discussion of the history of survey science, upcoming efforts like LSST, and what it means to work with publicly-available survey data.*
- 📝 **Presentation:** [Astronomical data and Gaia](./working_with_gaia_data.pdf)
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Working with Gaia data](./intro_to_gaia_data.ipynb) - *I coded live so students could follow along.*
- 🕑 **Coworking time:** Milestones 1 and 2

## Assignments

Students were expected to complete and submit Milestone 1 by the end of the day, then begin working on Milestone 2. I also asked them to complete a short, anonymous [mid-course review survey](../mid_course_review.pdf) to provide feedback on the course so far, so that I could make adjustments for the rest of the semester.

## Notes

- Once again, I had a bit too much content and had to skip over some of the more interactive sessions. This should be the other way around, with interactive sessions prioritized.
- I don't have notes for David's presentation, but am happy to share more details.
