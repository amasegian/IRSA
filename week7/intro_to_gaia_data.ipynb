    "This notebook will introduce you to working with data from the Gaia spacecraft. Though Gaia data can be searched and retrieved from [ESA's Gaia Archive](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/), it's often more convenient to do this with Python. For example, if you're systematically retrieving Gaia observations for several different patches of sky, you might want to write a script to carry out the retrieval automatically rather than having to perform the searches one-by-one by hand.\n",

The base unit of angular size is the degree. As you probably know, a full circle is divided into 360°. One degree can be divided into 60 arcminutes (abbreviated 60 arcmin or 60'). An arcminute can also be divided into 60 arcseconds (abbreviated 60 arcsec or 60\"). \n",
