# Week 14

Hear from students about their semester-long projects, and celebrate all their hard work!

## Schedule

- ðŸ‘¥ **Final presentations:** Students present their semester-long projects
- ðŸŽ‰ **Wrapping up:** Celebration and exit survey

## Assignments

None.

## Notes

- For the final presentations, each student was expected to give an individual talk (since this is very common in astronomy). When scheduling, I made sure that students who worked on the same project were spaced out by at least two talks to prevent comparison.
- Most of the talks were 5-7 minutes in length, without having to enforce timing
- Students were asked to complete the exit survey before leaving the classroom
- We brought in some snacks (popcorn, homemade cookies) and drinks (various sodas) to add to the celebration vibes :)
