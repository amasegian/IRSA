# Week 5

Continue introducing coding in Python and discuss how to get involved in research as an undergrad.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Doing research as an undergrad](./research_as_an_undergrad.pdf)
- 📝 **Presentation:** [Intro to Python 2](./intro_to_coding_2.pdf) - *I split-screened the slides with a text editor and coded live so students could follow along.*
- 🕑 **Coworking time:** Milestone 1

## Assignments

I provided another set of [Python exercises](./python_exercises_2.pdf) that reviewed the topics we had covered so far. Students were also expected to keep working on Milestone 1.

## Notes

- Pacing was a lot better than week 4 because the amount of original Python content was reduced
- I tried to make things interactive by having them share functions they had written in our course Slack, but I think I could've increased interactivity even more with small group work/sharing.
- I have noticed that functions are a very confusing concept for first-time programmers, and I think only about half the class understood after today's lecture. More reinforcement would have been helpful.
