# Week 4

Introduce coding with Python!

## Schedule

- üìù **Presentation:** [Intro to the terminal and Unix](./intro_to_coding_1.pdf) - *I split-screened the slides with a terminal and coded live so students could follow along.*
- üìù **Presentation:** [Intro to Python 1](./intro_to_coding_1.pdf) - *Ditto the above.*
- üïë **Coworking time:** Milestone 1
  
## Assignments

I provided a set of [Python exercises](./python_exercises_1) that reviewed the topics we covered in class. Students were also expected to keep working on Milestone 1.

## Notes

- I ended up with WAY too much content to cover in the three-hour class. In the future, I would cut this down significantly by focusing more on what students need to know for the coding they'd be doing in their projects that trying to cover everything (dictionaries, for example, can probably be left out) 
- *Astronomical Python: An introduction to modern scientific programming* by Imad Pasha is a great text resource for this portion of the class. I used examples from it in my lecture, but I probably should have integrated it even more.
- Lecturing about coding is hard. Even when you ask students to follow along themselves, it's easy to lose their interest. This portion of the course should be made as interactive as possible, and students should be given small group working time throughout the class (which of course means even more content has to be cut).
- For students with any previous Python experience, this class will likely be boring. I addressed this by having them start the Python exercises, but I probably should have provided even more extra material.
- We didn't have any horrible installation issues, but make sure to ask students to run "conda activate" before class instead of JUST installing Miniconda.
