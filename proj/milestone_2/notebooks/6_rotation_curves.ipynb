    "# Project 6: How do the different components of a galaxy affect its rotation curve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies don't rotate like solid disks -- instead, the circular velocity of stars and gas changes as a function of radius. This **rotation curve** is closely tied to the galaxy's mass distribution, including both visible components (such as bulges and disks) and invisible components like **dark matter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For spiral galaxies like our Milky Way, the classical expectation from visible matter alone is that rotation speed should drop off with increasing radius. However, observations show that the outer parts of galaxies continue to rotate more quickly than expected. This discrepancy is one of the key pieces of evidence for [dark matter haloes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to dark matter, there are several other major components that contribute to a galaxy’s mass distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bulge**: A compact, central concentration of stars (often spherical or slightly flattened)\n",
    "2. **Disk**: The large-scale distribution of stars and gas in a rotating disk (responsible for spiral arms in spiral galaxies)\n",
    "3. **Dark matter halo**: An extended, more or less spherical distribution of dark matter that makes up the majority of the galaxy’s mass\n",
    "4. **Supermassive black hole**: A massive central object sometimes found at the center of galaxies; in the Milky Way, this is [Sagittarius A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The total rotation curve of a galaxy is just the sum of each individual component. By modeling these components as theoretical **gravitational potentials**, we can investigate how each contributes to the observed rotation curves of galaxies. In this project, you'll use a Python package called `galpy` to do exactly that. You'll then attempt to build a simple model of a real galaxy's rotation curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this project will involve working with the rotation curve of a real galaxy (which you'll be assigned at the beginning of the project). We'll use rotation curves from the [SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves)](http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/) database, which is described in [Federico+2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152..157L/abstract). The data is stored in an FTP archive [here](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/AJ/152/157#/browse). \n",
    "\n",
    "The FTP archive is organized in a slightly frustrating way. The `ReadMe` file describes the columns for each of the tables, which are stored in separate files. You'll want to download `table2.dat`, which is stored [here](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/AJ/152/157/table2.dat). To make associating the column names with the data easier, I've copied them over from the `ReadMe` file and stored them in a variable called `columns` below. If you use Astropy's `Table.read()` to load in your data, you can pass `names=columns` to automatically add the column names to the resulting table. The columns we care the most about are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Name`: The name of the galaxy\n",
    "2. `Rad`: The radius at which each circular velocity measurement was made\n",
    "3. `Vobs`: The circular velocity measurements\n",
    "4. `e_Vobs`: The error on the circular velocity measurements\n",

    "## Using `galpy` \n",
    "\n",
    "`galpy` is a Python package designed to study the dynamics of stars, star clusters, and galaxies. It provides analytical implementations of gravitational potentials that are commonly used for modeling components of galaxies, such as disks, bulges, and halos. It also includes methods for integrating orbits, calculating velocities, and more. The basics are explained below, but you should also check out the [documentation](https://galpy.readthedocs.io)!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a gravitational potential as a function defining the strength of gravity at every point in space. Different components of galaxies have different mass distributions, and therefore need to be modeled with different potentials. Some common potentials to be aware of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Miyamoto-Nagai** (`MiyamotoNagaiPotential`): A flattened, disk-like model with scale length `a`, scale height `b`, and total mass `amp`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Hernquist** (`HernquistPotential`): A spherical model for central bulges or elliptical galaxies, defined by a scale length `a` and total mass `amp`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)** (`NFWPotential`): A commonly used model for dark matter halos, with a scale length `a` and a total mass or density scale `amp`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Keplerian** (`KeplerPotential`): A model for the gravitational field of a point-like object (like a  supermassive black hole) with mass `amp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can initialize a `galpy` potential with the following syntax: `var_name = PotentialName(...)`, where the `...` is replaced with the relevant potential parameters (described above, and also in the [documentation](https://galpy.readthedocs.io)). To combine multiple potentials, simply add them with the `+` operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a rotation curve with `galpy`, use the [`galpy.potential.vcirc`](https://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/reference/potentialvcircs.html) function to find the circular velocity for a given radius and potential. If you repeat this computation for a sequence of radii, you'll be able to plot the rotation curve, with radius on the x-axis and circular velocity on the y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Construct a simple model\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `galpy` to construct a simulated galaxy with a stellar disk, central bulge, and dark matter halo. To do this, first define a potential for each individual component, then sum the potentials together. The parameters that you should adopt for each component are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disk:** `MiyamotoNagaiPotential` with a scale length of 3.0, a scale height of 0.28, and an amplitude of 1.0\n",
    "- **Bulge:** `HernquistPotential` with a scale length of 0.6 and an amplitude of 0.2\n",
    "- **Dark matter halo:** `NFWPotential` with a scale length of 10.0 and an amplitude of 5.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "Generate an array of simulated galactic radii ranging from 0 to 50 kpc. For each individual component AND the total model, calculate rotation curves over this radius range. Plot the results and comment on any trends you see. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: These starting parameters were chosen somewhat arbitrarily in order to produce a model that will generate interesting results when tweaked in the next step. `galpy` is quite powerful and could produce basically any rotation curve we want!*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Experiment with different galaxy components\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the simple model you created above to test how each individual component affects the galaxy's rotation curve. For each subtask, you'll be asked to vary *one* parameter; everything else should be kept the same as in your simple model. Calculate and plot the new rotation curves and compare them to the total rotation curve from step 1. Finally, comment on any trends you observe and the physical implications of your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2a. Changing the bulge mass\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with changing the total mass of the `HernquistPotential` and report your results as described above. Choose at least 3 new mass values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2b. Changing the disk scale length\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scale length $a$** of a galaxy characterizes how extended its stellar disk is. A smaller $a$ means that the stars (and mass) are more concentrated toward the center, whereas a larger $a$ means that the disk mass is spread out over a wider region. Experiment with changing the scale length of the `MiyamotoNagaiPotential` and report your results as described above. Choose at least 3 new scale length values. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2c. Removing the dark matter halo\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with removing the dark matter halo from your simple model. In other words, build a potential with just the disk and bulge components. Report your results as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2d. Adding a central supermassive black hole\n",
    "\n",
    "Many galaxies, including the Milky Way, harbor **supermassive black holes (SMBHs)** at their centers. Their masses can range from millions to billions of times that of our Sun. Add a SMBH to your simple model by including a `KeplerPotential` with a mass appropriate for a supermassive black hole (e.g. $4 \\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$ for the Milky Way). Report your results as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Retrieve rotation curve data for a real galaxy\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the [SPARC database](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/J/AJ/152/157/table2.dat) of rotation curves and load it into your notebook in a format that's easy to work with. (Astropy's `Table` class and the associated `Table.read()` function are highly recommended!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've read in the data, filter the table so that it only contains rows for which `Name` is the same as the name of your galaxy. For help filtering tables, look back at the `intro_to_gaia_data` notebook from week 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Predict components for rotation curve model\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a scatterplot of the rotation curve data for your real galaxy, with radius on the x-axis and circular velocity on the y-axis. Add errorbars to the circular velocities, which you can do with [`matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the shape of the observed rotation curve and what you’ve learned from your experimental tests in Step 2, make an initial hypothesis about which components (bulge, disk, halo, and/or black hole) are needed to model the rotation curve of your galaxy. Record your hypothesis in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Fit rotation curve model\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the function outline provided (`real_galaxy_model`) to define a rotation curve model that includes the components you identified in step 4. The function inputs should be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. An array of radius values to calculate the model circular velocities at \n",
    "2. The `amp` parameter for each component potential\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're trying to model real data, the `amp` values will need to be in solar masses rather than the dimensionless `galpy` units we've been using so far. The function outline shows how to do this. For each component potential, first include a line like Example 1 that converts the input into `galpy` units. Then, when you're ready to initialize the potential, make sure to include the `ro=ro_val, vo=vo_val` arguments that are shown in Example 2 along with all the potential parameters. Use the inputted amplitude for `amp`; additional parameters for each component (like `a` and `b`) will be provided along with the name of your galaxy. Your function should return an array of circular velocities corresponding to the inputted radius values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once your function is complete, use `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to determine the amplitudes that best fit your observed rotation curve data. You should specify the optional argument `bounds=(0, np.inf)` to ensure that your parameters stay positive (since negative masses would be unphysical). When considering initial guesses for your parameters, keep in mind that typical disk masses are of order $10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, typical dark halo masses are of order $10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, typical bulge masses are of order $10^9 M_{\\odot}$, and typical SMBH masses are of order $10^6 - 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$. You may have to try a few combinations of initial parameters before you get a good fit with `scipy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Report the best fit values (which should be in solar masses) and comment on the results. Replot your rotation curve and show the best-fit line on your plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a brief (1-2 paragraphs) interpretation of the results you found above. Link it back to your original research question and key concepts from your literature review. (For this project in particular, you might consider thinking about which components contribute most and least to a galaxy's total rotation curve.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, write a brief (1-2 paragraphs) reflection on the limitations of your analysis. Are there any caveats or assumptions in your analysis? Could more data or a different method provide more robust results?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending your analysis (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there additional aspects of the dataset that you’d like to explore? Do you have ideas for refining the methods used in this notebook? Or maybe you’ve noticed an interesting pattern in your results that raises new questions? If you answered yes to any of these questions, I encourage you to extend your analysis! Feel free to reach out to me via email or visit office hours to discuss your ideas. If you're interested in diving deeper but aren’t sure where to start, I’m also happy to brainstorm with you. This is a great opportunity to practice developing your own research questions and exploring a dataset in a way that interests you.\n",
