# Week 12

Discuss scientific writing and the publication/peer review process.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Science writing and publication](./scientific_writing.pdf) - *Led by Aware Deshmukh.*
- 📝 **Presentation:** [Creating a compelling CV/resume](./CVs_and_resumes.pdf)
- 🕑 **Coworking time:** Milestone 2

## Assignments

Students were expected to submit Milestone 2 by the end of the day, then begin working on Milestone 3.

## Notes

- The students were very engaged in the CV/resume discussion, and several of them made use of the template I provided!
- I took out the "Undergraduate student resume" example for privacy reasons (I had used my partner's resume, with his permission) but adding this example back in is helpful to show the CV-resume contrast.
