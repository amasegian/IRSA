# Week 6

Finish introducing coding in Python, and discuss plotting (both in general and in terms of how to make plots with Python).

## Schedule

- üìù **Presentation:** [Intro to Python 3](./intro_to_coding_3.pdf) - *I split-screened the slides with a Jupyter notebook and coded live so students could follow along.*
- üìù **Presentation:** [Making good plots](./plotting.pdf)
- üë• **Discussion:** Panel of current Columbia graduate students - *I had 5 PhD students in various stages of their academic careers come to talk with the students. I prepared some [questions](./questions_for_panelists.pdf) in advance, but allowed the conversation to mostly be led by the students. Students were also able to submit questions anonymously through a Google Form.*
- üõ†Ô∏è **Activity:** [Plotting with Python](./intro_to_plotting.ipynb) - *I walked through the notebook live and had students help me code.*

## Assignments

I provided one last set of [Python exercises](./python_exercises_3.pdf). Students were also expected to keep working on Milestone 1.

## Notes

- I had a bit too much content this week as well; we were supposed to have coworking time but didn't have time, and I had to rush through the plotting notebook. In the future, I think I would reorganize the schedule to allow one more week for the Python introduction.
- The panel went well and was well-received by the students. In the future, I would:
  - Set expectations with the panelists in advance about how long to spend on each question
  - Ask the students to focus on broadly-applicable questions (rather than specific to their personal situation, which can be discussed in office hours)
