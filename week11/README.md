# Week 11

Introduce students to the FITS file format, and have them manipulate FITS images in the commonly-used software SAO DS9. 

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Working with FITS files](./FITS_files_and_DS9.pdf)
- 📝 **Presentation:** Using DS9 - *I performed a live demo of how to open, move around, and draw regions on FITS files with DS9.*
- 🛠️ **Activity:** Measuring photometry in DS9 - *Students worked in small groups to manipulate images and measure photometry in DS9. The activity is described in the [slides](./FITS_files_and_DS9.pdf) and [this notebook](./fits_ds9.ipynb) was used to make plots from their measurements.* 
- 💬 **Discussion:** [Making the most of a summer research experience](./making_the_most_of_summer_research.pdf) - *I provided some tips and discussed FAQs with students.*

## Assignments

Students were expected to continue working on Milestone 2.

## Notes

- All students were able to successfully install DS9 before class!
- Students were not the biggest fans of DS9, describing it as a bit archaic and hard to get used to. But they worked together well and were able to complete the activity.
- In the future, I might film the live demo and provide it to students in advance for them to watch and refer to. Taking notes on a live demo is hard.
