# Week 13

Discuss how to give an effective oral presentation.

## Schedule

- 📝 **Presentation:** [Scientific conferences](./scientific_conferences.pdf)
- 📝 **Presentation:** How *not* to give a talk - *Presented by David Helfand. David gave two versions of the same short talk -- one bad and one good -- and asked students to identify the differences, then discussed best practices.*
- 🛠️ **Activity:** [Reflection on how the semester went](./week13_reflection.pdf) - *Students were asked to complete the attached Google Form. I told them that their responses would not be graded.*

## Assignments

Students were expected to complete Milestone 3 by the next (last) class, where they would present their work to their peers.

## Notes

- If using Google Forms for the reflections, make sure that the setting to automatically send respondents a copy of their responses is toggled on; it's helpful for students to be able to refer back to their Week 2 reflection when completing their Week 13 reflection
